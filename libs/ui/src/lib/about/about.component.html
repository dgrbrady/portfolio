<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is David and I'm a full stack developer with a passion for 
  all things web dev! My strengths are in Typescript and Angular, but I take an
  eclectic approach to my developer arsenal and love learning new things!
  Check out my links below :)

<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>This site serves as a landing page to all my side projects 
  (that I actually finish) and was made with love using Angular in an Nx
  monorepo. There are no 3rd party libraries used. Everything you see has been
  built from the ground up. My hope is that it will accurately showcase what I 
  am capable of and serve as a time capsule for my growth in the future. 
  I hope you enjoy!
</p>
